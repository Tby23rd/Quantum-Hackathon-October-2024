# Sildenafil (Viagra) Repurposing Simulation

This Python script simulates the process of drug repurposing for Sildenafil (Viagra) using a quantum computing approach. It models the interaction between Sildenafil and various protein targets to predict potential new uses or understand side effects.

## Overview

The simulation uses a 12-qubit quantum circuit to represent drug-target interactions. It calculates binding affinities between Sildenafil and different protein targets, including its known target for erectile dysfunction (ED), a target associated with side effects, and potential new targets.

## Dependencies

- PennyLane
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (optional, for visualization)

## Key Components

1. `drug_target_interaction(params, drug_features, target_features)`:
   - Quantum circuit that simulates the interaction between a drug and a target.
   - Uses 6 qubits each for drug and target features.
   - Applies parameterized quantum gates and entangling operations.
   - Returns expectation values of PauliZ measurements on all qubits.

2. `binding_affinity(params, drug_features, target_features)`:
   - Calculates the binding affinity between the drug and target.
   - Uses the mean of quantum measurements as a proxy for binding strength.

3. `simulate_drug_repurposing(known_drug_features, targets, optimization_steps=300)`:
   - Main function that simulates the drug repurposing process.
   - Optimizes interaction parameters for each target.
   - Uses PennyLane's AdamOptimizer for parameter updates.
   - Returns calculated affinities for each target.

## Simulation Details

- Drug: Sildenafil (Viagra)
- Number of qubits: 12
- Optimization steps: 300
- Targets simulated:
  1. PDE5 (Known target for ED treatment)
  2. PDE6 (Associated with vision side effects)
  3. Myosin light chain kinase (Potential target for menstrual cramps)
  4. Nitric oxide synthase (Related to blood flow mechanism)

## Usage

Run the script to perform the simulation:



The script will output:
1. Progress of the simulation for each target.
2. Final binding affinities for each target.
3. Ranked list of potential targets based on binding affinity.
4. A bar plot visualizing the binding affinities (if Matplotlib is available).

## Interpretation of Results

- Higher binding affinity values indicate stronger interactions.
- The known target (PDE5) should show high affinity.
- Targets with lower affinity may be less likely to be effective new uses.
- Targets with moderate affinity might explain side effects or suggest potential new applications.

## Limitations

- This is a simplified model and does not capture all aspects of real drug-target interactions.
- The quantum circuit and optimization process are basic examples and may need refinement for real-world applications.
- Results should be interpreted as preliminary predictions requiring further experimental validation.

## Future Enhancements

- Incorporate more detailed molecular features for both drug and targets.
- Expand the quantum circuit to capture more complex interactions.
- Integrate classical molecular dynamics simulations for validation.
- Implement error mitigation techniques for potential use on real quantum hardware.
